Welcome to the PowerBI Hospitality Metrics Dashboard repository! This project focuses on analyzing key metrics in the hospitality industry using PowerBI to aid in revenue optimization strategies.

## Overview

The PowerBI Hospitality Metrics Dashboard is designed to provide insightful visualizations of key metrics such as Average Daily Rate (ADR), 
Occupancy Percentage, Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN), and Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN). 
By leveraging PowerBI's capabilities, the dashboard offers interactive and visually appealing insights to help hotel management make informed decisions.

## Key Metrics

- **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** Indicates the average revenue generated per room per day.
- **Occupancy Percentage:** Reflects how full the hotel is on any given day.
- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):** Calculates revenue generated per room available for sale.
- **Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN):** Measures the number of rooms actually occupied by guests each day.
- **Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN):** Signifies the number of rooms booked by guests each day.

  
*If the Average Daily Rate (ADR) remains constant over time, it suggests that the hotel is maintaining a fixed pricing strategy,
potentially missing out on opportunities for revenue optimization. Introducing dynamic pricing,
which involves adjusting room rates based on demand fluctuations and market conditions,
can help hotels maximize revenue by ensuring that room rates align with current demand levels and competitor pricing.
By implementing dynamic pricing strategies, hotels can improve revenue potential, remain competitive, and enhance profitability in the hospitality industry.*
